The core objective of Task 3 is to create an HTML registration form that captures various details from users who wish to register for a particular event. The form should include typical fields required for such a scenario—full name, email address, contact number, gender, date of birth, address, city, state, pin code, event category, and a few others as required.

This task not only assesses a student's or developer’s proficiency in structuring forms but also in enhancing usability using CSS. Students are expected to style the form using an external stylesheet, ensuring the design is modern and responsive. They must also apply appropriate validation techniques to make sure the data collected is accurate and complete.

Form Elements
The form includes multiple standard HTML form elements:

Text fields for inputting name, address, city, and state.

Email field to capture a properly formatted email address.

Date picker to choose the date of birth.

Radio buttons for selecting gender.

Dropdown menus (select elements) to choose state or event categories.

Number fields for pin code or contact number.

Textarea for additional information if required.

Submit and Reset buttons for form submission or clearing all inputs.

Each element should be clearly labeled and grouped logically to improve the user experience.

Design and Layout
Styling the form using CSS is a critical component of this task. Developers should make use of CSS features such as:

Box model for spacing and padding.

Flexbox or Grid layout for responsive alignment.

Font styling and background colors to improve readability.

Hover and focus effects to enhance interactivity.

The goal is to make the form not just functional but visually appealing and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

Validation and Accessibility
While the form’s primary design lies in HTML and CSS, developers are encouraged to use basic HTML validation features:

required attributes on critical fields.

Input types that enforce data format (e.g., type="email").

Pattern attributes for regex-based validation.

Moreover, accessibility features should be considered, such as:

Using semantic HTML.

Associating labels with input fields using the for attribute.

Ensuring color contrasts meet accessibility standards.# Description# PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-WEBPAGE
